  <strong>Holy guacamole!</strong> You should check in on some of those fields below.

1. Start with [base.html](https://github.com/liquidvisual/swell-0918/blob/master/src/_layouts/base.html)
It's a clean build with legacy styles and scripts broken off into partials (the order is important). I haven't merged any of the old codebase in, but once done we can eventually audit these separately, and remove anything that's no longer necessary. Closing body script assets are now **/assets/scripts/minified-hls.js** and **/assets/scripts/minified.js**.

2. There's two main layouts which control page layout.
See [base__page.html](https://github.com/liquidvisual/swell-0918/blob/master/src/_layouts/base__page.html) and [base__page_sidebar.html](https://github.com/liquidvisual/swell-0918/blob/master/src/_layouts/base__page_sidebar.html).

3. The main Nav and Off-canvas are rendered by a single recursive partial [nav.html](https://github.com/liquidvisual/swell-0918/blob/master/src/_includes/components/navigation/nav.html) using [sitemap.json](https://github.com/liquidvisual/swell-0918/blob/master/src/_data/sitemap.json). The contents of the this file were taken from the existing one (unmodified). Additional menu items were added around them.

4. State classes are placed on the body **.theme-paid** and **.theme-logged-in**

5. Common partials for the rest are found here, [header.html](https://github.com/liquidvisual/swell-0918/blob/master/src/_includes/components/layout/header.html) and [footer.html](https://github.com/liquidvisual/swell-0918/blob/master/src/_includes/components/layout/footer.html).
