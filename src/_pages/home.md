They want someone with knowledge of the body. We just want the body. Jerry: Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?

How there's two nuts named after people: Hazel and Filbert. Estelle Costanza: You're not giving away our waterpik!, Jerry : I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, you double your wardrobe.
