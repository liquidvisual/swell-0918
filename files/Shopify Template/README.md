# Shopify Template (2024)

These files should give the jist of how everything is put together - not guaranteed to be in date with prod. To keep things simple (albeit less efficient) everything is copy-pasted into the Shopify editor using the build files. Sections are hardcoded, removing the liquid logic (eg the nav loops).

-   Attempts were made to load `sitemap.json` remotely but due to template blocking, this became too complex so opted just to import it as an asset at the downside of duplication.
